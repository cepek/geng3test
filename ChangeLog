	* Maintenance release gama-2.28, no user-visible changes.

	- The helper program gama-local-deformation was split to
	Deformation.h/.cpp class with minimal remaining program
	gama-local-deformation.cpp.

	- Added a simple autotools tests for deformation results
	(equivalent test was already available in cmake build).

	* Maintenance release gama-2.27, no user-visible changes.

	- Fixed the bug in two test suite functions in the Krumm examples
	collection.

	- Updated version of krumm/2D/Wolf_DistanceDirectionAngle_free.xml

	The bug in the function mgon2cc(), conversion from milligons to
	centigrades, was reported by Greg Troxer. The scope of the bug was
	limited to Krumm's test suite, collection of
	examples. Unfortunatelly the bug was shadowed by another bug in
	Input::spatial_distances(string), where mgon2cc() was erroneously
	used instead of m2mm() conversion. To elliminate the bug in
	Krumm's examples collection the file
	Wolf_DistanceDirectionAngle_free.xml had to be updated, replaced
	with the new correct version.

2023-09-26   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	* Maintenance release gama-2.26

	* Fix the buggy SVG class (in the program gamma-local, version
	2.25, an error was introduced in the generation of graphic output
	in SVG format, resulting in wrong orientation of x,y axis).

2023-08-15   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	* New program gama-local-deformation (processing two adjustment
	epochs to compute point shifts and thei covariance matrix)

	* Updated version of SVG class with rendering ellipses
	and shift vectiors

	* C++14 standard


2023-02-16   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	Maintenance release gama-2.24

	* new testing data to gama-g3 test suite

	* Fixed a bug in gama-g3 adjustment xml output of vectors

	* Fixed the definition of reference standard deviation in the
	gama-g3 input XML

	* xml/gnu-gama-data.xsd version 1.01 new tags
	<reference-variance-apriory/> and
	<reference-variance-aposteriori/>

	* Added a test on conversion of coordinates XYZ to ellipsoidal BLH
	and back Add an implicit constructor to the Ellipsoid class
	(implicit ellipsoid is SWG 84) and enable the next iteration in
	xyz2blh(), which improves the transformation XYZ to BLS from 1e-7
	to 1e-9 meters. Added a test on conversion from BLH to XYZ to the
	CMake build

	* Added test on positive definite covariance matrix in input XML
	and test on covariance matrix dimension and bandwidth in
	DataParser_g3


2022-06-30   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	New release 2.20

	* New algorithm ICGS in the class AdjGSO replaced the former
	algorithm MGS.

	* Deleted file .var/deprecated/gama-local-pro.cpp (a helper
	program for generating gama-local.pro; the qmake based project is
	not supported anymore)


2022-04-26   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	New release 2.19

	* New glossary of basic terms used in gama-local text output and
	in documentation.

	* Fixed tests/gama-local/tests/gama-local.sh to work with GNSS
	vectors (bug in HTML output for inconsistent systems).

	* Fixed a bug in tests/gama-local-xml-results.sh (program
	check_xml_results). For inconsistent coordinate systems Ydiff part
	of the vector has its sign changed on output.


2022-04-09   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	New release 2.18

	* Conversion program krumm2gama-local and the testing suite for
	input data format used in the text book "Geodetic Network
	Adjustment Examples" by Friedhelm Krumm, Geodätisches Institut
	Universität Stuttgart, 2020.


2022-01-07   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	New release 2.17

	* library libgama changed from OBJECTS to static in CMakeLists.txt

	* minor changes needed by qgama to implement xml input format export

	* new function Observation::raw_value()

	Observation function value() returns observed value with all
	corrections added (if they are defined).  New function raw_value()
	returns raw observed value without the corrections. This function
	is needed in qgama GUI observation editor.

	* HACKING: Describe release process (by Greg Troxel)

	Describe the release process, including some checks.  This is
	partially capturing existing practice, and is not meant to be a
	significant change.
	Reorder to put the long build tools discussion last, fix typos.


2021-11-25   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	New release 2.16 (maintenance release)

	* Top level directory 'bin' was renamed to 'src'. Originally 'lib'
	contained only gama-local.cpp, gama-g3 was added later and some
	more helper application like gama-local-yaml2gkf also. The
	directory was named 'bin' because autools build system puts Gama
	application binaries there when 'make' is run. But the final
	destination for Gama executables is defined by the command 'make
	install' where option --prefix can change the implicit
	destination. Thus the directory is more important because of the
	source codes it contains than because of the compiled binaries
	stored there.

	* Prepared gama-local for more observational correction to be
	added in future releases. Currently only benchmark corrections for
	height of instrument and hoieght of sight are implemented.

	* Gama-local option '--updated-xml' was renamed to '--export'
	and similarly was renamed the corresponging test
	tests/gama-local/gama-local-export.sh

	* More input examples have been added to the gama-local test suite

2021-09-20   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	New release 2.15 (maintenance release)

	* observation reductions are separated from observed values in
	GNU_gama::local::Observation objects (now is possible to
	repeatedly calculate reductions in linearization adjustment cykle
	if needed; observed raw data are not changed during the adjustment).

	* Conditional debug build #add_definitions(-DDEBUG_REDUCED_OBS) to
	display reductions of observations

	* Cleaning up code in gnu_gama/local/acord/reduce_observations.h|.cpp

	* A minor fix in gnu_gama/local/language.cpp. The english
	abbreviation for zenith angle was '_zenit_' which looked more like
	a typo than as an abbrevitaion and was changed to '_zen.__'.

	* Added four methods to the class GNU_gama::local::Point,
	reduction(), set_reduction(), unset_xyz() and test_xyz()

	* Undocumented extension to enable previous XML syntax
	'<gama-xml>' in lib/gnu_gama/xml/gkfparser.cpp

	if (!strcmp(c, "gama-xml")) return tag_gama_xml;


2021-02-28   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	* new release 2.14

	* fixed html output format. In qgama widget QtTextEdit rendered
	wrong tables with colspan attributes an all <td> tags had to be
	written explicitly. Occured in table of adjusted coordinates.

	* changed spelling homogenised to homogenized

	* Explicit initialization of pointer members in g3::Model constructor
	The bug reported by Greg Troxel: SparseMatrix <>*  A; in g3/g3_model.h

	* removed 'final' specifier for local observations destructor in
	lib/gnu_gama/local/observation.h


2021-01-15   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	* new release 2.13

	* Conversions between yaml and input xml (gkf) tested for all
	available data files in the tests suite (subdirectory gama-local).

	* Command line programs gama-local, gama-local-yaml2gkf and
	gama-local-gkf2yaml can now read input data from standard input.


2020-11-20   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	* new release 2.12

	* Alternative support of input data based on YAML format. YAML
	support was added for gama-local as an alternative to the existing
	XML input format. The YAML support is currently limited only to a
	conversion program gama-local-yaml2gkf but it may be fully
	integrated in gama-local program later.


2020-10-27   Ales Cepek <cepek@gnu.org>

	* new release 2.11

	* In test suites all template input files *.in (used to generate
	test shell scripts *.sh) were renamed to *.sh_ . Tests suit
	subdirectory scripts were renamed to src.

	It was slightly confusing to have input files named as *.in
	because this extension is used in Makefile.in files which are
	generated from Makefile.am.

	* Added a new option --enable-extra-tests (default is no) to the
	configure.ac script. Extra gama-local test may be running
	substantially longer (for example see railway-control.gkf).

	* Removed obscure adjustment parameter
	'update-constraiend-parameters'. The update effected SqliteReader
	lib/gnu_gama/local/sqlitereader.cpp, classes LocalNetwork and
	GKFparser and file gnu-gama-data.xsd.

	* Removed gnu-gama-data.dtd and all its references (superseded by
	.xsd), several XML files were updated in tests/gama-g3 to use
	gnu-gama-data xsd definition.


2020-09-25   Petra Millarova <millapet@gnu.org>

	* new release 2.10
