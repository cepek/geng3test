Observation data examples in this directory come from diploma theses
of students of CTU in Prague. The file extensions are as follows:

- Files with the extension ".gkf" are adjustment input data for the
  program Gama-local. These files contain data in XML format. For
  historical reasons, the ".gkf" extension is used to distinguish
  input files from output XML files.
- Files with the extension ".xml" contain corresponding adjustment
  results in XML format.

The handle to the full text of all the theses used here is given in
the `<description>` tag in the corresponding *.gkf file.
