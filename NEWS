GNU Gama NEWS - History of user-visible changes.

Changes in release 2.31 (2024-09-15)

  This release fixes a bug in handling the list of removed
  observations (local network adjustment). This bug did not influence
  command line tool gama-local, but was fatal for qgama interactive
  application.

Changes in release 2.30 (2024-03-19)

  The maintenance release, no user-visible changes in existing
  programs.

  - README files changed to README.md format, some minor formulation
    changes and enhancements.

  - Review of doxygen handling, include brief section on doxygen into
    documentation.

Changes in release 2.29 (2024-02-19)

  The maintenance release, no user-visible changes in existing
  programs.

  - New helper program compare-xyz was added; the program is used in
    testing suite and currently is in alpha version.

  - There are two major programs in the GNU gama project: gama-local
    and gama-g3. The version of these two programs is same as version of
    the release, 2.29 in this release. Apart of tese two, there are also
    helper minion prorgam, used for example in testing suite. These
    minion program are:

      compare-xyz, gama-local-deformation, gama-local-gkf2yaml,
      gama-local-xml2sql, gama-local-xml2txt, gama-local-yaml2gkf and
      krumm2gama-local

    Changes in these programs normally need not to yield the change of
    the whole package. To avoid possible confusion between two different
    version of these helper programs, they vere assigned their own minon
    version, for example compare-xyz 2.29-0.3.

Changes in release 2.28 (2024-01-10)

  The maintenance release, no user-visible changes.

  - The helper program gama-local-deformation was split to
    Deformation.h/.cpp class with minimal remaining program
    gama-local-deformation.cpp.

  - Added a simple autotools tests for deformation results (equivalent
    test was already available in cmake build).

Changes in release 2.27 (2023-11-04)

  The maintenance release, no user-visible changes.

  - Fixed the bug in two test suite functions in the Krumm examples
    collection.

  - Updated version of krumm/2D/Wolf_DistanceDirectionAngle_free.xml

Changes in release 2.26 (2023-09-26)

  - Fixed the buggy GNU_gama::local::SVG class.

Changes in release 2.25.1 (2023-09-24)

  - new version number for packagers, because two versions of the 2.25
    distfile were posted.

Changes in release 2.25 (2023-08-23)

  - new program gama-local-deformation for processing two adjustment
    epochs to calculate potential points position changes (shift
    vectors).

  - change from c++11 version to c++14

  - New glossary of basic terms used in gama-local text output and in
    documentation.

Changes in release 2.24 (2023-02-16)

  - new testing data to gama-g3 test suite

  - xml/gnu-gama-data.xsd version 1.01, new tags
    <reference-variance-apriory/> and <reference-variance-aposteriori/>

Changes in release 2.23 (2022-09-12)

  - Fixed the bug in gama-local reading sqlite3 database.  The bug was
    introduced after version 2.10 when testing shell scripts were
    updated to be generated from templates .sh_ files (testing
    templates .sh_ use symbolic names like @INPUT_FILES@ or $RES etc).

    More readeable output format in check_xml_coordinates.cpp test.


Changes in release 2.22 (2022-09-02)

  - Denny Fiedler reported inconsitent adjustment reports.
    XML adjustment ouput differed from text and html formats
    in description of Chi-square test of standard deviation.

    New XML tag <not-applicable/> was added to the adjustment ouput
    format for cases with zero degrees of freedom, where the standard
    deviation test is not applicable (previously there were only
    two tags <passed/> and <failed/>).

  - New gama-local adjustment XML output definition
    gama-local-adjustment.xsd version 1.02.

    Old XML output files are formally complient with the new XSD
    version 1.02, but three testing files were updated in the
    directory tests/gama-local/input/
       minimal.xml
       triangle-1.xml
       triangle-2.xml


Changes in release 2.21 (2022-07-10)

  - Fix Cholesky decomposition of CovMat class

    In gama-local the cluster covariance matrix can be defined in three
    ways: by implicit standard deviations, by explicit specification of
    observations’ standard deviations or by direct definition of the cluster
    covariance band matrix. When reading input, gama-local must check that
    the resulting covariance matrix is positive definite.  If the input does
    not have any of the above three covariance representations, the
    covariance matrix variable contains only zeros.  Due to a bug, the
    parser (using class CovMat) failed to detect the bad input data. The bug
    was fixed and the scaling of tolerance for detecting semidefinite
    matrices now uses the maximum of all diagonal elements, rather then only
    the first diagonal element.

  - Fix the bug in test linearization visitor for Angle

    The visitor did not test if the right hand direction of the angle
    pointed to a fixed point or to an adjustment point. If it was a fixed
    point visitor added corrections from vector x with index 0, i.e. index
    outside the vector.

    Added file bug/test-linearization-angle.gkf and .xml to test all
    possible combinations of angles with fixed and adjusment points.

    The bug was reported by Greg Troxel on netbsd 9 amd64.


Changes in release 2.20 (2022-06-30)

  - The new algorithm ICGS (iterated classical Gram-Schmidt) in the
    class AdjGSO replaced the former algorithm MGS (modified
    Gram-Schmidt), which was implemented with column pivoting as a
    template class GSO. The template class GSO is meant only as a tool
    for testing purposes. Both initial scaling and pivoting with
    euclidean norms are not suitable for practical computations.

    The old legacy code with MGS used in the AdjGSO class is still
    available with conditional compilation directive statements if the
    name GNU_GAMA_GSO_LEGACY_CODE is defined.


Changes in release 2.19 (2022-04-26)

  - fixed a bug in HTML output of adjustment results for GNSS vectors
    in incosistent coordinates systems.

  - added new test to GNU Gama Test Suite.


Changes in release 2.18 (2022-04-09)

  New conversion class K2gkf (lib/krumm) with accompanying program
  krumm2gama-local and the testing suite for converting input data
  format used in the text book "Geodetic Network Adjustment Examples" by
  Friedhelm Krumm, Geodätisches Institut Universität Stuttgart, 2020.

  Not all input data in Krumm format can be converted to GNU Gama,
  i.e. to the adjustment program gama-local input XML:

    - scale factor is not implemented in gama-local adjustment

    - gama-local does not enable fixing only x coordinate (or y
      coordinate) for 2D free network to remove singularity. This kind
      of regularization has very little practical meaning. Technically
      it would be possible to enable this feature in gama-local, but it
      is questionable if the outcome would not enable more confusion
      than possible outcome. Adustment should not be dependent on the
      coordinate system used.

    - gama-local does not deduce that an azimuth to the unknown point
      P can be combined with some angle pointing to the P to create a
      new feigned azimuth. This is an interesting feature which may
      be implemented in some future version, namely in the gama-local
      stage of computing approximate coordinates.

    - nonlinear conditions are not implemented in gama-local

    - BLH coordinates are not supported in gama-local


Changes in release 2.17 (2022-01-07)

  A maintenance release, no user-visible changes.


Changes in release 2.16 (2021-11-25)

  A maintenance release, the only user-visible changes are new
  gama-local option --export (renamed from --updated-xml) and some
  more tests ins gama-local sets suite.


Changes in release 2.15 (2021-09-20)

  A maintenance release, no user-visible changes.


Changes in release 2.14 (2021-02-28)

* Maintainers release

* fixed html output format.

  The html format in GNU gama was correct, but in Qgama the table of
  adjusted coordinates with colspan attributes the Qt widget
  QtTextEdit rendered the table wrong and all <td> tags had to be
  written explicitly.


Changes in release 2.13 (2021-01-15)

* Conversions between yaml and input xml (gkf) tested for all
  available data files in the tests suite (subdirectory gama-local).

* Command line programs gama-local, gama-local-yaml2gkf and
  gama-local-gkf2yaml can now read input data from standard input.

* New exlicit parameter --input-xml in gama-local (previously input
  file was the first parameter)

* Fixed test of ratio apriori/aposteriori values (localnetworkxml.cpp)

* Fixed implicit model for distance stddev (gama-local adjustment model)

* Fixed new attribute angular in documentation


Changes in release 2.12 (2020-11-28)

* Alternative support of input data based on YAML format. YAML support
  was added for gama-local as an alternative to the existing XML input
  format. The YAML support is currently limited only to a conversion
  program gama-local-yaml2gkf but it may be fully integrated in
  gama-local program later.


Release 2.11 October 2020

* Maintainers' release

* Removed gnu-gama-data.dtd and all its references (superseded by
  .xsd), several XML files were updated in tests/gama-g3 to use
  gnu-gama-data xsd definition.


Release 2.10 September 2020

* Adjustment results output in Octave format (.m file) with independent
  test of adjustment results (regularization of singular systems by
  the set of constraints).

* update-constrained-coordinates parameter removed from the input XML
  data format


Release 2.09 June 2020

* There is one major fix visible to end users. Implicit value of XML
  parameter 'update_constrained_coordinates' was changed to "yes". The
  behavior of adjustment calculation was well and clearly described in
  the documentation, but in some cases the old implicit value ("no")
  might have led to poor numerical results. The input data XML
  parameter 'update_constrained_coordinates' is preserved only for
  backward compatibility and is likely to be removed in some future
  release.

  This release is a kind of preparation stage for the next release
  where 'update-constrained-coordinates' parameter shall be removed
  from the input XML data format.


Release 2.08 December 2019

Maintainer's release

* new test data krasovsky-1926 with full reference in biblatex
  (renamed from bug-2019-04-23-oleg-goussev)

* new unit test for extern attributes in gama-local/scripts/check_externs.cpp

* new HACKING.md by Greg Troxel explicitly declares that autotools are
  the primary build system and alternative build like CMake must never
  influence the primary Gama builds.

* Legacy builds with expat-1.1 is available only as an testing option

* C++ sources cleanup mainly in lib/gama/local to conform with C++11

* C++11 standard is explicitly set in configure.ac (for testing C++14
  is set on in the alternative builds in the main CMakeLists.txt)


Release 2.07 August 2019

* Fixed some bugs in AcordPolar and AcordTraverse classes.
  More algorithms in Acord2 class

Release 2.06 July 2019

* Fixed two bugs (html output format and segmentation fault)

Release 2.05 May 2019

* The program gama-local for adjustment of local surveying networks
  used a C++ class Acord for computing approximate coordinates of
  adjusted points, if these were not explicitly given on
  input. Acord's computations were based on intersections (and local
  transformations if necessary) of the tuples of determining
  observations (for example a bearing and a distance). Gama-local
  expected input data to be free of blunders, which might be a strong
  assumption in practice.

  New class Acord2 was introduced as a robust alternative for typical
  two dimensional input configurations (Acord2 is not a complete
  general solution yet); the idea is to find all (or as many as possible)
  solutions of coordinates of a selected point and use their median as
  the robust position estimation. Algorithm Acord2 is followed by the
  original Acord intersections in gama-local, before the adjustment
  solution of the network. Acord2 is based on the master's thesis by
  Petra Millarová <petramillarova@gmail.com>

Release 2.04 March 2019

* experimental qmake project file gama-local.pro to be used where
cmake is not available with Qt distribution on Windows. CMakeLists.txt
project is prefered over gama-local.pro.

Release 2.03 February 2019

* The new attribute "extern" suggested by Kristian Evers (Danish
  Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency) was added both to the
  gama-local xml input and adjustment results xml output to be
  conformant with an external database project. Information supplied in
  "extern" attributes of observations are not processed in any way in
  gama-local and are only passively transfered to XML adjustement
  output.

Release 2.02 November 2018

* Improved Hungarian translation by Siki Zoltan:
   "I would like to inform you that we just have finished a guide to
   networks used in engineering surveying. It will be a booklet of the
   Hungarian Chamber of Engineers. It mostly contains practical guide of
   the network adjustment and blunders detection. In the examples GNU
   Gama was used (and GeoEasy).
   During this work we have improved the Hungarian translation."

Release 2.01 September 2018

* Maintainer's release
* Conditional build for gama-g3 enabled implicitly
* XML schema definition for gama-g3 adjustment results with new
  xmllint testsuite

Release 2.00 May 2018

* Maintainer's release: for the list of internal changes see ChangeLog

Release 1.21 November 2017

* Maintainer's release : internal matrix/vectors memory management
  replaced with a new implementation using C++11 move constructor and
  move asignment syntax.

Release 1.20 November 2017

* New test suite for matvec classes and support for valgrind memory
  leak tests for tests/matvec and tests/gama-local.

     This release is a preperation phase for the next release in which
     the base matvec memory handling class (MemRep) will reimplemented
     with C++11 move constructor and move assignemnt operator.

Release 1.19 June 2017

* fixed a bug introduced in 1.16, reported by Pierre Bosser
        <pierre.bosser@ensta-bretagne.fr>. Implicit value of
        covariance band in XML adjustment output is -1 (full
        bandwidth).

Release 1.18 August 2016

* configure.ac : patch by Greg Troxel <gdt@lexort.com>
     CPPFLAGS was set with +=, which is a bash extension and fails on
     POSIX-conforming shells.  This resulted in sqlite3 support not being
     enabled on NetBSD, even though the sqlite3 library was found and
     linked in.
* fixed some minor problems reported by Greg Troxel (doc, NEWS)
* in local/network.cpp commented out // removed_obs.clear();
* fixed a formatting bug in outlaying terms (due to c++11)
* fixed a bug in HTML parser test
* simplified class LocalPoint
* fixed a bug in sql export reported by Dominik Hladik
* added @documentencoding UTF-8 into gama.texi

Release 1.17 November 2015

* new set of functions for handling inconsistent systems
* fixed two bugs reported by Greg Troxel

Release 1.16 July 2015

* minor fixes in documentation
* fixed a bug in SQL schema
* new export of XML network definition
* C++11 features enabled (-std=c++11 for g++ compiler)
* fixed several minor bugs

Release 1.15 February 2014

* DTD replaced with XSD for gama-local.xsd and
  gama-local-adjustment.xsd. Attribute version describing XML version
  of input and adjustment outpup XML documents became useles with
  introduction of XSD a was removed from tags <gama-local> and
  <gama-local-adjustment>. Some more elements attributes were
  introduced in revised XML formats which are incompatible with older
  versions.

Release 1.14 June 2013

* A posteriori standard deviation Chi-Square test is newly always
  performed (even when gama-local uses a priori reference standard
  deviation).

* Added Chinese translation in GBK encoding (switch "zh")

* New output format XHTML Strict 1.0 in gama-local

* Added a basic test suite for gama-local (make check).


Changes from 1.9.00 to 1.9.01
