# Code

*I have a cmake c++ project. Is it possible to convert it automatically
to a MS Code project with all those scattered jason files?  I am
working on Linux. And is there any potential advantage to leave the
cmake project that perfectly works with qtcreator? Whay I am even
considering it is, that I like code editor better than that of
qtcreator.*

You can easily set up VS Code to work with your CMake project
without manually scattering JSON files. Here’s how:

### Install Extensions

* Install the CMake Tools extension in VS Code.
* If using Qt, also install the Qt for VS Code extension.

### Open Your Project in VS Code

* Open the folder containing your CMakeLists.txt.

### Configure CMake

* VS Code should detect the CMakeLists.txt file automatically.
* Click on the CMake Tools status bar at the bottom to select your generator (e.g., Ninja, Unix Makefiles, or MinGW Makefiles).
* Choose the desired build configuration (Debug/Release).

### Build & Run

* Use the CMake: Build and CMake: Run commands from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

## Advantages of Using VS Code:

* Better Code Editor (which you prefer)
* More Customization Options
* IntelliSense & Code Navigation (especially with Clangd)
* Easier Debugging Integration (with launch.json, but not mandatory)
* Faster & Lighter than Qt Creator

## Disadvantages:

* No Built-in Qt Designer (you’d need to launch designer separately)
* Slightly More Setup for Qt Projects (but nothing complicated)
* More Manual Debug Configuration (Qt Creator simplifies this)

Since your project already works with CMake in Qt Creator, switching
to VS Code is straightforward. You don’t need to scatter JSON files
manually—VS Code will handle CMakePresets.json and settings.json as
needed. Would you like help with configuring something specific?

*I cannot see the CMake Tools status bar, but the project configured
automatically*

If your project configured automatically, VS Code is already
recognizing your CMake setup. However, if the CMake Tools status bar
is missing, try these steps:

1. Ensure the CMake Tools Extension is Installed

   Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for CMake Tools. If
   it’s not installed, install it and restart VS Code.

2. Enable the CMake Tools Status Bar

   * Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
   * Type and select CMake: Enable Status Bar.
   * If it still doesn't appear, try disabling and re-enabling
     the CMake Tools extension.

3. Check if the Status Bar is Hidden

   Sometimes, the status bar may be hidden due to UI settings. Try:

     * Right-click on the status bar and check if "CMake" is disabled. If
       it is, enable it.
     * Resize the VS Code window—sometimes elements get pushed out.

4. Use CMake Tools Commands Manually

   If the status bar still doesn't show up, you can use the Command
   Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type CMake: to see available options like:

      * CMake: Configure
      * CMake: Build
      * CMake: Select Kit (to choose a compiler)
      * CMake: Select Configure Preset (if using presets)
